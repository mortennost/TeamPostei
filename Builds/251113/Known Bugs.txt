Movement:
   - The two bottom nodes of "cornered" blocks can be moved out of bounds. 
     Need to add safety calculation for this not to happen.

           regardless of current rotation.



Spawning: 
   - First "Placeable" Block spawned is not shown (same as last build). 
     Reason for occurance still unknown.
     Workaround: Press "ENTER" to spawn new block. This will not affect the board in any way.
